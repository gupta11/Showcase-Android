Basically, listner is used for sending back to method where it come from.

Like we are on any activity, and we want to use common function, but we also want to do some operation on result which is
retrived from that common function, and if those operation will be simple db operation then we can might adjust via flags, but
those are related to ui elemenets, like hide show then we must perform those things into activity itself..

At that place, this listners will come into picture, like activity, will call common function, bt also pass one listner
( "createAppoListner" into file BookAppointmentAcitivty.java  and passed to "AppointmentCreateCalls" into BaseActivity )
and into BaseActivity once operation perform that result will be pass back to listner, which is come again to parent activity
 mean "BookAppointmentAcitivty.java".

 ===============

 Listner is nothing but interface

 public interface ReturnListner {
         public void returnResult(String value);
     }


we can implement into acitity, and use the methos returnResult for retriving result.
